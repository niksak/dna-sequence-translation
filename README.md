# dna-sequence-translation
mini projects


Translates DNA sequences into protein sequences using the 'standard' genetic code. Remember that coding DNA is 'read' as triplet 'codons,' each of which is translated into a specific amino acid.

 It translate 3-letter DNA codons into 1-letter amino acid codes. For example, ATG gets translated to M, TGG translates to W, etc. As a standard convention, we will translate any "Stop" codons to the code, *.
 
 The input for now is from keyboard. You give the DNA sequence until you enter a stop triplet as discribed here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_codon
